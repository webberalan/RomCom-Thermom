    "The HARBOR at Miami Beach fades in, \r\n                         providing quick views of yachts, aquaplanes, \r\n                         and luxurious ship-craft lying at anchor \r\n                         in the calm, tranquil waters of tropical \r\n                         Florida. This dissolves to the NAME \r\n                         PLATE on the side of a yacht, reading \r\n                         \"ELSPETH II,\" and this in turn to a \r\n                         YACHT CORRIDOR where a steward is standing \r\n                         in front of a cabin door, near a small \r\n                         collapsible table upon which there is \r\n                         a tray of steaming food. He lifts lids \r\n                         and examines the contents. A heavy-set \r\n                         sailor stands guard near the cabin door.[1]",

Then we get a view of the CABIN \r\n                         at the door, as Andrews enters and closes \r\n                         the door behind him. He looks around \r\n                         and his eyes light on his prisoner, \r\n                         following which the view swings over \r\n                         to ELLIE, a beautiful girl in her early \r\n                         twenties. At the moment, she holds a \r\n                         small vase over her head ready to heave \r\n                         it, and her eyes flash angrily. At sight \r\n                         of her new visitor, however, she lowers \r\n                         the vase and sets it on a small table.",

In the background \r\n                         we see the autogyro idling. A closer \r\n                         view shows a small platform, serving \r\n                         as an altar. Over it there is an arbor \r\n                         of roses. Back of the altar stands a \r\n                         minister, ready.
