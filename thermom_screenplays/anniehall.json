      "There's an old joke.  Uh, two elderly \r\n\t\twomen are at a Catskills mountain \r\n\t\tresort, and one of 'em says: \"Boy, the \r\n\t\tfood at this place is really terrible.\" \r\n\t\tThe other one says, \"Yeah, I know, and \r\n\t\tsuch ... small portions.\" Well, that's \r\n\t\tessentially how I feel about life.  Full \r\n\t\tof loneliness and misery and suffering \r\n\t\tand unhappiness, and it's all over much \r\n\t\ttoo quickly.  The-the other important \r\n\t\tjoke for me is one that's, uh, usually \r\n\t\tattributed to Groucho Marx, but I think \r\n\t\tit appears originally in Freud's wit and \r\n\t\tits relation to the unconscious.  And it \r\n\t\tgoes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ... \r\n\t\t\"I would never wanna belong to any club \r\n\t\tthat would have someone like me for a \r\n\t\tmember.\" That's the key joke of my adult \r\n\t\tlife in terms of my relationships with \r\n\t\twomen.  Tsch, you know, lately the \r\n\t\tstrangest things have been going \r\n\t\tthrough my mind, 'cause I turned forty, \r\n\t\ttsch, and I guess I'm going through a \r\n\t\tlife crisis or something, I don't know. \r\n\t\tI, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging.  \r\n\t\tI'm not one o' those characters, you know. \r\n\t\tAlthough I'm balding slightly on top, that's \r\n\t\tabout the worst you can say about me.  I, \r\n\t\tuh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get \r\n\t\tolder, you know?  I think I'm gonna be the-\r\n\t\tthe balding virile type, you know, as \r\n\t\topposed to say the, uh, distinguished \r\n\t\tgray, for instance, you know?  'Less I'm \r\n\t\tneither o' those two. Unless I'm one o' \r\n\t\tthose guys with saliva dribbling out of \r\n\t\this mouth who wanders into a cafeteria \r\n\t\twith a shopping bag screaming about \r\n\t\tsocialism. \r\n\t\t\t(Sighing) \r\n\t\tAnnie and I broke up and I-I still can't \r\n\t\tget my mind around that.  You know, I-I \r\n\t\tkeep sifting the pieces of the relationship \r\n\t\tthrough my mind and-and examining my life \r\n\t\tand tryin' to figure out where did the \r\n\t\tscrew-up come, you know, and a year ago we \r\n\t\twere... tsch, in love.  You know, and-and-and \r\n\t\t... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a \r\n\t\tmorose type.  I'm not a depressive character.  \r\n\t\tI-I-I, uh, \r\n\t\t\t(Laughing) \r\n\t\tyou know, I was a reasonably happy kid, \r\n\t\tI guess.  I was brought up in Brooklyn \r\n\t\tduring World War II.",
